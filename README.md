# KrunchyAudio
 *Turns your audio into crunchiness™*
 
## How to use
Replace the input.mp3 to any mp3 you would like.
Then run the script. If you do not have FFMPEG installed in the working directory then the script will automatically install it for you.

Then pick a option.

I will choose 5.
Then depending on how long your audio is, it will generate your crunchy audio.

Input:

Output (Level: 5):

## How to install
### The program comes with a `installib.bat` file which installs all the libraries needed and FFMPEG.
Simply run it and wait for it to install everything.
